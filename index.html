	<h1><u>Annotated Bibliography - Ethical Veganism</u></h1>
	
	<p>Evan Miles<br>INLS 501<br>December 7, 2018</p>
		
	<h2><u>Introduction and Overview</u></h2>
	
	<div class="a">
	
	<p>Foods that market themselves as plant-based alternatives to meat and dairy options (such as veggie burgers, vegan cheese, non-dairy ice cream, etc.) have grown in popularity in recent years. In 2017, sales of these types of foods in the United States grew 8.1% compared to the previous year and accounted for $3.1 billion in revenue. (Reinhart, 2018) Likewise, Google searches for “vegan” increased by 33% in 2016 and searches for non-dairy items increased over 200%. (Spector, 2016) Despite this growth in interest, the number of people identifying as vegan or vegetarian has not grown according to a recent Gallup poll in August 2018 that compared results to 2012 and 2008 surveys by Gallup (Reinhart, 2018). The difference between demand for these types of products and the number of people identifying as vegan or vegetarian indicates a gulf might exist between veganism as an ethical framework and dietary choices of a total population which are influenced by other factors such as economic status, health, and culture. Since ethics are just one factor that impacts our decisions, albeit an important one, this annotated bibliography provides a list of sources that explains the ethical framework behind veganism and why people might choose to adopt it.</p>

	<p>As a starting point, <i>The Oxford Handbook of Food Ethics</i> provides a useful and simplistic definition of ethical veganism, “veganism is a pattern of living: roughly, to be vegan is to avoid eating or otherwise using products made from or by animals” (McPherson, 2018). While this definition does not inform the reader of reasons why one might be a vegan or ways in which that position manifests itself in daily life, it is a broad definition of purpose of veganism that is widely accepted. The insufficiency of this definition, however, requires further understanding of the concept of veganism, its ethical implications, history, and goals. For that, a wide variety of sources can be used. This annotated bibliography provides a selection of the major sources regarding ethical veganism. Included are works from a variety of mediums, genres, and decades that give a wide-ranging explanation. There is no assumed audience for this annotated bibliography other than a reader who is interested in the topic. Instead, resources on the topic encompass a wide variety of people, backgrounds, and interests. While some materials might be more suitable for some readers, most readers should be able to find some resources that are of interest to them. The purpose of this annotated bibliography is to give an understanding of the development of veganism, explore the major issues of animal welfare and rights that vegans are concerned with, and highlight the diversity of approaches to veganism to foster a better understanding of the topic.</p>

	<ul>
		
		<li>Adams, C.J. (2010). <i>The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory.</i> London : Continuum.</li>
		
		<p>Adams’ <i>The Sexual Politics of Meat</i> is a long-standing, provocative philosophical work that connects our dietary choices to societal conceptions of masculinity/femininity, heteronormativity, and patriarchal power structures. She argues that our current systems of animal agriculture and societal views on meat eating enforce violent patriarchal attitudes of dominion over others. Adams’ extends feminist theory to animal agriculture to argue for a practice of equality that extends across species. While this is a work of feminist philosophy, it is wrong to limit it to that. This work contains discussions on why meat eating is a societal norm, how systems of animal agriculture have developed, and how our lives of impacted by animal agriculture. A content warning is necessary as this book discussions traumatic themes of physical harm, sexual violence, and exploitation. Originally published in 1990, this work is historically important as a work of late-twentieth century feminist criticism. Cited above is the 2010 edition which contains revised and updated examples since its original publication. For further reading on the topic, Adams has also published other books on the subject of the intersection of feminism and the animal rights movement. </p>
		
		<br><li>Benton, T. (1993). <i>Natural Relations: Ecology, Animal Rights, and Social Justice.</i> New York : Verso.</li>
		
		<p>Benton’s <i>Natural Relations</i> is a socialist argument for animal rights. In this philosophical work, Benton makes the case for animal rights by extending socialist critiques of human rights to animal. He builds upon animal rights theories and major socialist thinkers such as Marx. While this book is a case for animal rights, Benton does not openly advocate for a conventional definition of veganism which is a personal choice to abstain from buying or using animal products. The typical liberal viewpoint of focusing on rights as a matter of individual choices is insufficient. Instead, Benton examines the contexts and structures that underpin ethical discussions. In Benton’s “ecological socialist” view of rights, progress regarding animal rights will come through the social and economic circumstances that dictate our world. This book is interesting for its intersectional argument. Benton breaks from the works of major animal rights philosophers such as Regan and Singer to provide a new framework for our understanding of veganism that builds upon socialist ethical, political, and economic theories. As a result, this work is reliant on a previous understanding of animal rights philosophy and socialist thought that might make this work challenging for some.</P>
		
		<br><li>Regan, T. (1984). <i>The Case for Animal Rights.</i> London: Routledge & Kegan Paul.</li>
		
		<p>Tom Regan’s <i>The Case for Animal Rights</i> is a highly influential philosophy book on veganism. The American philosopher Tom Regan argues in this book for the intrinsic values of animals. This intrinsic value is derived from animals’ mental and physical capacities making them subjects-of-life as many animals have their own beliefs, desires, perceptions, and identities. While animals’ experiences are potentially entirely different from humans, the existence of such capacities means animals have intrinsic value and should not be treated as means to an end. The edition cited above is the original 1984 publication. Other updated and revised editions are also available. This edition was chosen to emphasize the historical significance. Regan wrote many books on animal ethics, this one being the most significant to the field. Regan follows in the footsteps of Peter Singer in Animal Liberation in writing a keystone work in the field of animal ethics and brought animal rights and welfare to the forefront of philosophical discussion on human obligation and ethics. As a scholarly philosophy book, however, the technical terms, references to other theories in the field, argumentation, and conventions might be difficult for some.</p>
		
		<br><li>Singer, P. (1975). <i>Animal Liberation.</i> New York: Random House.</li>
		
		<p>Peter Singer’s <i>Animal Liberation</i> is one of the most influential books regarding veganism. Peter Singer is an Australian philosopher who focuses on applied ethics and utilitarianism. In this book he argues that according to utilitarian ethics one should attempt to minimize the harm that their actions produce. An animal’s capacity to feel pain means that humans have an ethical obligation to consider their suffering when making decisions. To disregard the suffering of non-humans and to prioritize the interests of one species over another is speciesism, a term which Singer popularized. This critical work by Singer is a keystone work of philosophical writings on veganism that has influenced many other philosophers. The edition cited above is the original 1975 version of the work. Revised and updated editions are also available. The original edition was selected to emphasize the historical importance of this work. While this work is immensely important to the growth of veganism, the work is an academic philosophy book that uses technical terms and conventions that might be difficult for some. This book is suited for individuals wanting to learn more about veganism as a theory, not just a practice.</p>

		<li>Foer, J. S. (2009). <i>Eating Animals.</i> New York : Little, Brown and Co.</li>
		
		<p>Jonathan Safran Foer’s 2009 book <i>Eating Animals</i> is a narrative account of the author’s search to understanding the food industry. Upon the birth of his first son, Foer decides to make the best possible choices when raising his son. Foer researches food production and alternatives to current methods. He examines both the health and ethical aspects of current food production systems and how these systems have changed in recent decades. He visits farms, consults experts, and joins advocacy groups. His experience with a meat industry lacking transparency and practicing widespread and unregulated animal abuses prompts Foer to decide that supporting that industry is unethical for him and his family since food is so deeply connected to our own personal values and sense of ethics. This book is unique for its narrative approach. Foer effectively blends anecdotal personal experience with data-supported insights into food production as a whole. It is a useful post-modern alternative to the keystone philosophical works about veganism and is suitable for a wide audience of readers. </p>
	
		<br><li>Stuart, T. (2007). <i>The Bloodless Revolution: A Cultural History of Vegetarianism from 1600 to Modern Times.</i> New York : W.W. Norton & Company.</li>
		
		<p>This comprehensive and long historical book by Tristam Stuart documents the history of animal rights and welfare issues from the early modern period to today. The book is organized mostly by important figures such as chapters on Rousseau, Shelley, and Newton. Other deal with larger historical events. Stuart argues that the longer history of animal welfare and rights concerns in Europe was the result of the radical political and social figures adopting aspects of value systems from the Eastern hemispheres, notably Hindu beliefs from India. This book is interesting for its long historical approach and broad definition of animal rights. Rather than veganism being the product of post-modern philosophical thought from major academics of the late-twentieth century like Regan and Singer, Stuart shows how the modern animal welfare movement is the result of a long historical process. This book is long at almost six hundred pages and at times the historical text can be dense. This work, however, is useful for those with an interest in historical scholarship and wish to learn more about the animal welfare movement in Europe.</p>

		<p>In 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States released a report on sources of greenhouse gases contributing to anthropogenic global climate change in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The full report contains chapters on global trends in greenhouse gases and estimated impacts of certain economic sectors. One chapter is devoted entirely to the impact of agriculture. Much of this chapter is focuses on the impact of animal agriculture which is one of the largest contributors to global climate change. Discussion of the impact of animal agriculture on land use and global climate change is directly related to ethical veganism through our land ethic, which is the theoretical ethical frameworks we use that guide our use of land and natural resources. There is a link between our ethical choices and our contribution to global climate change. This chapter in the report is long and difficult to read for those without a background in environmental science. The statistics and visualizations, however, are useful. Given the political undercurrents of discussions on the agriculture industry and anthropogenic global climate change, this data is useful for its authoritative and unbiased source.</p>

		<p>In this essay, Dunham describes her experiences as a vegan and explores the intersection of her being a black woman and a vegan. As Dunham describes veganism as a social justice movement strives to promote equality and justice for all, yet has consistently enforced racialized notions and spaces since its inception as a movement in the mid-twentieth century. Correspondingly, Dunham argues that black communities generally has largely hesitant about animal rights and welfare topics as a result of cultural traditions and narratives of oppression. Dunham discusses ways to reconcile these two confliction positions and argues for black leadership in veganism that would both redefine veganism and empower black communities. This article is brief, easy to understand, and important. The elements of race in veganism are important topics that have long been excluded in both theoretical discussion and practice. This essay is part of a collection titled <i>Sistah Vegan</i>, which discusses various aspects of black veganism.</p>

		<p>“Seafood Ethics” is an essay written by Craig Harris in <i>The Routledge Handbook of Food Ethics.</i> This reference book contains section titled “Farming and Eating Other Animals” consisting of eight chapters, of which the above is included. Harris’s chapter focuses on a very particular issue of animal ethics – seafood. The popularity of diets such a pescatarian necessitates a direct discussion of animal ethics applied to aquatic life. The paper examines three broad areas of fishing – subsistence, recreational, and commercial – which each have their own particular ethical issues to be discussed. The paper is succinct and suitable for most readers. Harris does not solely focus on animal rights, but also the ecological and human issues of fishing. Harris examines fishing at the global level of interconnected systems. Harris uses an intersectional approach that covers issues of race, class, gender, and personal ethics. This approach is important to understanding the massive scope of global fishing and the impact of the industry on global economies and ecosystems. This broad view, however, does not properly address the underlying moral question of eating animals. Harris does not attempt to link current theory on animal ethics (often focused on land animals) to aquatic life.</p>

		<p>The Oxford Handbook of Food Ethics is a new reference source on issues related to food production, health, culture, and ethics. The book contains eight parts in total that covers this wide range in topics. Part III “Consumption” contains an article by Tristram McPherson titled “The Ethical Basis for Veganism”. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the different interpretations of veganism, how it is practiced in various international contexts, defenses of veganism from popular counter-arguments, and current issues facing veganism. The resource also contains a long list of resources consulted by McPherson when writing the article. This list ranges from academic works to popular novels. Overall, the article serves as a useful introduction to the topic. McPherson highlights the diversity of interpretations on the subject and the challenges it faces. McPherson does not impose any personal beliefs on the topic. While this objectivity is important in providing an overview of the subject, this hands-off overview style is a potential shortcoming as the article does not capture the emotional aspects of veganism as a response to a particular violent industrial system. To address this, other sources that are not strictly reference sources will need to be consulted.</p>

		<li>Monson, Shaun. (Director), (2005) <i>Earthlings</i> [Motion picture]. United States: Nation Earth.</li>
		
		<p>Earthlings is a 2005 documentary film directed by Shaun Monson and narrated by Joaquin Phoenix. The film documents the animal abuses by various industries. The film contains four broad chapters – the pet industry, food production, entertainment industry, and scientific research. It uses around six years of footage, including undercover footage. The film is gruesome and violent, including footage of torture and death. It should not be viewed by anyone who is unwilling to see that type of content. The graphic videos and images are important to understanding veganism. Unlike written descriptions, the videos are shocking and visceral which can provoke stronger responses in viewers. Earthlings shows how these industries systematically harm animals and connects it to the current world economy and the demand for products from these industries. This documentary is useful for understanding the connections between industries and the treatment of animals and how veganism might be an alternative to those practices.</p>
